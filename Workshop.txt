\section{Introduction}  
History education offers a rich and complex framework for developing critical thinking, fostering citizenship, building collective identity, and promoting understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives. It equips learners with analytical tools to examine contemporary society and make informed decisions about the future.  

This workshop proposes using Prolog to teach history through gamification. The initiative stems from a personal passion for historical studies and aims to demonstrate how Prolog can represent historical events characterized by diverse actors, actions, and decisions.  

A precedent exists in Daniel Weissberg's work, which employed Prolog to model the population complexity of Montsegur Castle during its 1244 siege. Weissberg emphasizes that computational tools in the humanities require carefully structured knowledge representation, as this foundation critically shapes subsequent interpretation and qualitative analysis.  

Recent efforts by Cervoni, Cechi, Hermenegildo, and others advocate reintroducing Prolog in primary and secondary education. Teaching Prolog cultivates logical reasoning, enhances entity-relationship identification (e.g., objects, concepts), and develops skills in applying inference rules to derive implicit knowledge or evaluate alternative logical formulations of problems [Cechi]. Its integration into curricula complements traditional subjects, enriching learning through a paradigm distinct from imperative, object-oriented, or functional programming [Cervoni 2023; Hermenegildo 2023].  

The workshop centers on an agent named *VBot*, designed with a knowledge base ("VBot's brain") that interfaces with its geographic environment. Prolog is integrated with Python's Folium library for geospatial visualization. The structure comprises three stages:  

1. Stage 1: Introduction to Prolog fundamentals (facts, entities, relationships) using BlocklyProlog for visual syntax representation.  
2. Stage 2: Construction of VBot's knowledge base, including entity definition, unary/binary relationships, and n-ary relationships. Geographic context is incorporated.  
3. Stage 3: Interactive trivia sessions where students query VBot using true/false questions, simple queries, rule-based queries, and geographic explorations.  

\section{Workshop Design}  
Targeted at 9–11-year-olds (4th grade), this workshop aligns with Venezuela’s integrative curriculum axes, emphasizing cross-disciplinary themes. Project-based learning fosters autonomy and collaboration, culminating in a tangible output. The axis "Geography, History, Homeland, and Citizenship" frames content on *La Campaña Admirable* (1813).  

The 3-hour workshop is structured as follows:  
- Hour 1: VBot Introduction: Objectives, Prolog fundamentals (facts, objects, relationships).  
- Hour 2: Building VBot's Brain: Encoding historical text into Prolog facts; formulating atomic, conjunctive, and rule-based queries.  
- Hour 3: Ask VBot: Trivia game with true/false questions and variable-driven queries.  

\subsection*{Historical Context [2, 3]}  
Venezuela’s independence movement began on April 19, 1810, establishing the First Republic. After its collapse (July 25, 1812), patriots retreated to Nueva Granada. *La Campaña Admirable* (1813) was motivated by:  
1. The First Republic’s fall,  
2. Monteverde’s threat to invade Nueva Granada,  
3. Patriotic aspirations to restore independence.  

Simón Bolívar launched the campaign from Cúcuta (February 16, 1813) with 500 troops, opposing Monteverde’s 17,000-strong royalist army. Key events include:  
- Battle of Cúcuta (February 28, 1813)  
- *Guerra a Muerte* decree (Trujillo, June 15, 1813)  
- Battles of Agua de Obispos (June 18), Niquitao (July 2), Horcones (July 22), Taguanes (July 31)  
- Liberation of Mérida (May 18), Barinas (July 1)  
- Triumphant entry into Caracas (August 6, 1813)

The 90-day campaign culminated in a 10,000-strong patriot army. Bolívar received the title *Liberator of Venezuela* (October 14, 1813). Consequences included liberated western provinces and the *Guerra a Muerte* decree (effective until the 1820 Trujillo Armistice).  

\subsection{The Brain of VBot}  
VBot is a bodiless agent encoding knowledge about *La Campaña Admirable* using Prolog (via BlocklyProlog). Its "brain" includes:  

- Unary Relationships (Facts):  
 
  comandante('Simon Bolivar').  
  liberada('Merida').  
  
 

- Binary Relationships:  
 
  jefe('Simon Bolivar','Atanasio Girardot').  
  
 

- N-ary Relationships:  
 
  enfrenta('Simon Bolivar','Julian Izquierdo','Taguanes').  
  
 

- Causes/Consequences:  
 
  causa('Perdida de la Primera Republica').  
  consecuencia('Decreto Guerra a Muerte','15 de junio 1813').  
  
 

\subsection*{Querying VBot}  
- Ground Atomic Queries:  
 
  ? jefe('Simon Bolivar','Atanasio Girardot').  % true  
  
 
- Queries with Variables:  
 
  ? batalla('Taguanes', Fecha).  % Fecha = '31 de julio 1813'  
  
 
- Conjunctive Queries:  
 
  ? jefe_campana(X, 'Campana Admirable'), lider(X, 'Ejercito Patriota').  
  
 
- Rules:  
 
  efectivo_patriota(X) :- comandante(X), jefe('Simon Bolivar', X).  
  
 
- Recursive Rules (Route Planning):  
 
  ruta(X,Y) :- conecta(X,Y).  
  ruta(X,Z) :- conecta(X,Y), ruta(Y,Z).  
  
 

\subsection{Ask VBot Game}  
A card-based trivia game uses:  
- Red Cards: True/false questions.  
- Blue Cards: Queries requiring variables/rules.  
Students form groups, draw cards, and pose queries to VBot. Teachers assist with query formulation. Points determine the winning group.

### Key Improvements:
1. Grammar & Syntax:  
   - Corrected tense consistency (e.g., "equips" instead of "provides tools").  
   - Removed redundancies (e.g., "rich and complex" → "rich, complex framework").  
   - Fixed prepositions (e.g., "tools *for* analyzing").  

2. Structure & Flow:  
   - Logical section transitions (Introduction → Workshop Design → Technical Implementation).  
   - Clearer bullet points and code annotations.  
   - Consolidated fragmented sentences (e.g., merged motivation paragraphs).  

3. Academic Tone:  
   - Replaced informal phrases (e.g., "my passion" → "a personal passion").  
   - Standardized terminology (e.g., "n-ary relationships" instead of "relationships with more than two objects").  
   - Formalized descriptions (e.g., "Project-based learning fosters autonomy" vs. "allows students to work").  

4. Clarity & Precision:  
   - Simplified ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "the agent’s knowledge base is complemented by..." → "Geographic context is incorporated").  
   - Fixed historical inconsistencies (corrected "2013" → "1813").  
   - Clarified Prolog concepts (e.g., "ground atomic queries" vs. "atomic queries with variables").  

5. Consistency:  
   - Uniform terminology (e.g., "VBot" not "Vebot/Vbot").  
   - Standardized date formats and proper nouns (e.g., "Simón Bolívar").
