              Brief Overview of the contents
 This documents presents an educational framework that transforms questions from a Prolog-based database into a historical learning experience. To this end, a card-based trivia game applied to history teaching is structured, with a progression mechanic, using a dual question system. The game includes dynamic map visualizations for historical locations, route visualization, and comparative analysis.
 Looking ahead, the use of a building-block language for the knowledge base and its integration with geovisualization capabilities are planned.

4-                  Prolog and visualization tools to teach history

This workshop integrates Prolog with visualization tools to teach history through gamification.
Why education in History?
History education provides a rich framework for developing critical thinking, fostering citizenship, building collective identity, and promoting understanding of diverse cultures.

What does Prolog contribute to history studies? 
 Prolog's ability to represent complex historical events involving multiple actors, decisions, actions, planning and scenario studies

Why geospatial visualization? 
Maps, time series, and spatiotemporal narratives reveal relationships within data, transform large data sets into coherent structures, and support multilevel analysis from overview to detail .
***********
5- Prolog in the school

There is a precedent for using Prolog for teaching historical facts in the work of Daniel Weissberg, who used micro-Prolog to model population dynamics during the siege of Montségur Castle in 1244. 

Moreover, there are recent initiatives advocate reintroducing Prolog in primary/secondary education. 

  -  Teaching with Prolog enhances logical reasoning, improves identification of entities/relationships, and develops skills in applying inference rules to derive implicit knowledge

6-                  Gamification
 Gamification applies game elements in non-gaming contexts  to encourage participation and optimize academic performance. 
Effective gamification in education extends beyond superficial rewards to include:
 
 --- Concrete, achievable goals with meaningful rewards.
 --- Collaborative/individual challenges developing co-responsibility
 --- Immediate feedback enabling self-regulated learning
 ---  Progressive complexity levels demonstrating achievement
 --- Personalized learning pathways 
 


**********************************************************************
7- Workshop Design
   -- Aimed at 4th grade students of basic schools (9 to 11 years old).

   -- this workshop is aligned with the Venezuelan curriculum based on integrative axes .  

   -- The integrative axes are defined as transversal themes that connect different areas of knowledge around a common theme, promoting a holistic vision of learning.
	
   -- Project-based learning, as a methodological strategy can be used
   --The workshop teaches history by constructing a Prolog knowledge base and conducting historical inquiries through queries. 
   --Students build context-specific knowledge bases interrogated via true/false questions, entity queries, and geographic explorations.

*************
8- Workshop Stage
The proposed workshop structure has three stages:
---- {Stage 1: Prolog Fundamentals}: Facts, objects, and relationships are introduced, likely using Blockly Prolog for visual representation of the syntax.

----- {Stage 2: Knowledge Base Construction}: Students extract information from source texts to encode entities, unary/binary relationships, and n-ary relationships. Formulating atomic queries, conjunctive queries, and rule creation are covered.

---- {Stage 3: Historical Inquiry Sessions}: Students complete trivia exercises using true/false questions, simple queries, rule-based queries, and geographic explorations. 
   
*************
9- workshop content

The integrative axis selected was "Geography, History, Homeland, and Citizenship," and the content developed was (Recognition of the route of the Admirable Campaign and the Eastern Campaign) The workshop will build content related to (La Campaña  Admirable).
The description of the content provided to the students is as follows:

*************
 10- Historical Context
	La Campaña Admirable  was a military action framed within the Venezuelan war of independence. It was commanded by Simón Bolívar, supported militarily and economically by the government of  Nueva Granada and achieved the emancipation of western Venezuela, made up at that time by the provinces of Mérida, Barinas, Trujillo and Caracas.

*************
11- Brief description of the war actions.

--- The Admirable Campaign begins on May 6, 1813.
--- On June 15, 1813, in Trujillo, Bolívar signed the Decree of War to the Death against the Spanish and the Canarians.
--- Next, this is a list of battles that occurred in 1813, with their protagonists and locations.
Finally,
---El libertador makes his triumphant entry into Caracas on 6 August 1813.

*************
12	-
This was the route followed by the Liberation Army. The route includes passage through the Andes mountain range, plains areas and part of the Coastal mountain range.	   

*************
*************

13- The knowledge Base

This database includes information about La Campaña Admirable. Its contents are described below.

Constant concepts and ground relationships with just one argument.  For example:
 
              comandante('Simon Bolivar').
                                
               or
            	liberada('Merida').
   
*************
14-  Ground binary relationships: Relationships are characterized by having more than one argument. For example: the relationship that indicates Simón Bolivar as the chief of Atanasio Girardot and José Felix Ribas. 
It is indicated as: 
  jefe('Simon Bolivar','Atanasio Girardot').
   jefe('Simon Bolivar','Jose Felix Ribas'). 

Simón Bolivar is the leader of La Campaña Admirable.      
  jefe_campana('Simon Bolivar', 'Campana Admirable') 
       
*************
15-   
Relationships are characterized by having more than two arguments. For example: The winning commander faces the losing commander in battle.
    
       
  The winning commander faces the losing commander in battle. 

  enfrenta('Atanasio Girardot', 'Manuel Canas', 'Agua de Obispo').
 enfrenta('Jose Felix Ribas', 'Jose Marti', 'Niquitao').
            
        
*************
16-  More about Relationships.
  The causes of La Campaña Admirable, as well as the consequences, can be expressed as these expressions:
           Causes of La Campaña Admirable: 
              Monteverde's threats of invasion of New Granada 
           Desires of patriotic forces to restore independence 
               
        Consequences of La  Campaña Admirable             
      Loss of the royalist army of 6,000 troops 
*************
17-   
        The knowledge base would be prepared to answer questions such as  
        -    Ground atomic queries: Is Simón Bolivar the chief of Atanasio Girardot? Is Monteverde the chief of José Felix Ribas?
           
        -  Atomic queries with variables: queries with an unknown to answer the questions what, when, where? 
    For example, the question what date did the Battle of Taguanes take place?
            
*************
18- Conjunctive queries: queries using the logical conjunction operator, and. 

 Who is the leader of the patriotic army and leader of La Campaña  Admirable?
             
            Leader of the Patriotic Army and Head of the Admirable Campaign  
                  
             where the Decreto de Guerra a Muerte was signed  
         
             Routes to the Battle of Horcones site 
                  
*************
19- 
 Rules allow for more elaborate relationships between objects. For example: 
    
        They are part of the patriotic army: they are commanders and their leader is Simon Bolivar.  
            
        They are part of the royalist army: they are commanders and their chief is Domingo Monteverde. 
             
         Causes of  La  Campaña  Admirable                     

*************
20- recursive Rules
  A recursive definition is one that is made in terms of itself. Recursion can be explained using the routes between cities:
            
        
*************
21-Trivia Game
The database querying process is designed as a question-and-answer game centered on the events of La Campaña Admirable. The game features a deck of cards distinguished by colored stripes: red for true/false questions and blue for questions requiring atomic queries, variable-based queries, or rules. Each card displays a participant question on its face. 

*************
22- Trivia Game

  Participants form groups, each selecting a name or avatar. Gameplay proceeds as follows:
--	Groups must answer at least five true/false questions  to reach 10 points.
--  Upon reaching 10 points, groups unlock blue card questions worth 4 points each.
--	The first group to accumulate 30 points wins.
 
The Figures  illustrates the deck design.
*************
23-   Certain questions incorporate geographic displays. 

              Prolog-Python integration is implemented via SWI-Prolog's Janus library . 
	    Python's Folium  library is used for geospatial visualizations.


*************
24-  
For example:
 
    Where did the Battle of Taguanes take place?
    Point out the location of the site on the map.
    Groups must consult the knowledge base to answer. After identifying the correct answer, they retrieve its geographic location with this 

          py_call('locate_site("Bocono")).  
      

     The output appears in Figure 
*************
25-  Students can also compare historical and modern routes  : 
 
  py_call("Ruta_campana')
  py_call('ruta("SanCristobal""Caracas")).  
 

Outputs are shown in Figure 
 
*************
26- Another Example

The following images show the base map to which layers provided by external services have been added. for example, layer with terrain elevations, and with satellite image. This adds a greater understanding of the path of the troops over the terrain covered. In addition, a supply planning exercise for troops could be designed considering the variables associated with geography.

another example shows  the base map with a layer from a satellite image.

*************
28- Future Work
  --- We plan to integrate geographic visualization capabilities into BlocklyProlog, to have an interface for building knowledge bases and queries.
  --- This tool would support the teaching of historical events, ecological studies, anthropological research  and scientific expeditions through the spatial context. 
  ---   We also plan to bring this workshop to primary schools.
*************
*************
29- conclusion
-- A process framework is presented that transforms the knowledge base query into a trivia game focused on historical events.
-- By integrating game mechanics based on spatial visualization using Prolog-Python integration, a learning system has been proposed where students progress from true/false questions to complex queries.
--A teacher-guided method has been outlined to ensure successful query formulation and knowledge discovery.
*************
30- conclusion
-- Our proposal shows how game mechanics can structure technical skills in knowledge base consultation and at the same time encourage greater interaction with historical content.
